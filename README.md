# Black-Friday-Sales-
**AIM**: Model for Black Friday Sales Prediction
**Prerequisite Skill**: Programming Language(python tools & libraries), Machine Learning & Deep Learning
**Project Type**: Research Paper
**OBJECTIVE**: To develop a model for predicting sales on Black Friday sales using past datasets available and to provide the retailer with ways to improve their services to increase sales in coming years on the feedback received from the customers. Various ML models like linear regression, decision tree, and random forest are used to predict the sales and choose the best model.
**CONCLUSION**: We find that the linear regression gives the best result for the model.The result shows that predicting Black Friday sales with a high root mean square error(RMSE) is possible.  various ways are suggested to increase the sales during black Friday sale, so that the retailers can make more profit. For increasing sales retailers must work smartly by keeping up with the trend.
